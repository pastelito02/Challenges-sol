I turn chickens red
and I will make you weep.
I make guys have to freak
and girls rub their cheeks.
I make the rich look stupid
and normal people look like they are rich.
I turn cakes yummy
and make your champagne run wild in your tummy.
If you squeeze me, I'll get happy.
If you look at me, you'll get sad.
